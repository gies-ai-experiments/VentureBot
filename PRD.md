## Appendix C: Example Agent Instruction Patterns (Extracted)

### Pattern 1: Memory-Aware Context Reading
```
Inputs you MUST read:
- memory['USER_PAIN'] (e.g., { "description": "...", "category": "functional|social|emotional|financial" })
- memory['user_input'] (any additional problem description, if present)
- memory['USER_PROFILE'] (user's name, background, interests)
```

### Pattern 2: Structured Output with User-Facing & Internal
```
Your role:
1) Generate [output] for user
2) Present readable format to user (markdown, no raw JSON)
3) Store structured data in memory['Key'] for downstream agents (INTERNAL ONLY)
```

### Pattern 3: Socratic Questioning Flow
```
Coaching approach:
- Ask "Why?" to understand deeper motivation
- Challenge assumptions: "What makes you think...?"
- Guide to self-discovery: "Let's explore that together..."
- Provide examples to illustrate concepts
- Celebrate insights: "Great observation! That's exactly..."
```

### Pattern 4: Action-Oriented Wrap-Up
```
End with bold call to action:
**"Reply with the number of the idea you want to validate next."**
**"Ready to build your product with no-code tools, or would you like to refine the plan further?"**
```

### Pattern 5: Error Handling & Graceful Degradation
```
Error handling:
- Timeout protection with retry mechanisms
- Fallback to alternative approaches if primary fails
- User-friendly error messages (no technical jargon)
- Maintain conversation flow despite errors
- Log errors for debugging but don't expose to user
```

- Go-to-market difficulty (distribution, acquisition)

**Scoring:**
- 0.8-1.0: Highly feasible with available tools, low barriers
- 0.5-0.7: Moderate complexity, achievable with learning
- 0.2-0.4: High complexity, significant barriers
- 0.0-0.1: Requires team, funding, or rare expertise

### Dimension 4: Innovation Potential (20% weight)
**Factors:**
- Uniqueness of approach
- Disruption potential (vs. incremental improvement)
- Defensibility and IP opportunities
- Alignment with emerging trends (AI, Web3, etc.)

**Scoring:**
- 0.8-1.0: Highly innovative, potential for disruption
- 0.5-0.7: Moderate innovation, clear improvement
- 0.2-0.4: Incremental improvement, limited novelty
- 0.0-0.1: Commodity or copycat

### Overall Score Calculation
```
Overall = (Market Opportunity × 0.30) +
          (Competitive Landscape × 0.25) +
          (Execution Feasibility × 0.25) +
          (Innovation Potential × 0.20)
```

### Confidence Scoring
- Based on data availability and quality
- High confidence (0.8-1.0): Rich market data, many competitors analyzed
- Medium confidence (0.5-0.7): Some data, moderate analysis
- Low confidence (0.2-0.4): Limited data, speculative

### Recommendation Thresholds
- **0.75+:** 🟢 Strong potential - proceed with confidence
- **0.55-0.74:** 🟡 Moderate potential - refine and proceed
- **0.35-0.54:** 🟠 Weak potential - pivot or major refinement needed
- **< 0.35:** 🔴 Not recommended - explore different ideas
